Description: SeqSender is a Python program that is designed to automate the process of generating necessary submission files (e.g. submission.xml, submission.zip, etc.) and then bulk uploading them via FTP to NCBI archives such as Genbank, BioSample, and SRA. Additionally, the program can batch uploading submissions of meta- and sequence-data to GISAID using their Command Line Interface Tools (e.g., EpiFlu and EpiCoV CLI). Currently, the pipeline is capable of uploading Influenza A Virus and SARS-COV-2 data.

# [Documentation](https://cdcgov.github.io/seqsender/)

## Overview

`seqsender` is a Python program that is developed to automate the
process of generating necessary submission files and batch uploading
them to <ins>NCBI archives</ins> (such as **BioSample**, **SRA**, and
**Genbank**) and <ins>GISAID databases</ins> (e.g. **EpiFlu**,
**EpiCoV**, **EpiPox**, **EpiArbo**). Presently, the pipeline is capable
of uploading **Influenza A Virus** (FLU), **SARS-COV-2** (COV),
**Monkeypox** (POX), **Arbovirus** (ARBO), and a wide variety of other
organisms. If you’d like to have `seqsender` support your virus create a
issue.

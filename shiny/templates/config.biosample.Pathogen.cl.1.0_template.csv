bs-host_health_state,Optional,Information regarding health state of the individual sampled at the time of sampling
bs-host_sex,Optional,Biological sex of the host
bs-host_subject_id,Optional,"a unique identifier by which each subject can be referred to, de-identified, e.g. #131"
bs-host_tissue_sampled,Optional,"name of body site where the sample was obtained from, such as a specific organ or tissue, e.g., tongue, lung. For foundational model of anatomy ontology (fma) (v 4.11.0) or Uber-anatomy ontology (UBERON) (v releases/2014-06-15) terms, please see http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/FMA or http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/UBERON"
bs-passage_history,Optional,Number of passages and passage method
bs-pathotype,Optional,"Some bacterial specific pathotypes (example Eschericia coli - STEC, UPEC)"
bs-serotype,Optional,"Taxonomy below subspecies; a variety (in bacteria, fungi or virus) usually based on its antigenic properties. Same as serovar and serogroup. e.g. serotype=""H1N1"" in Influenza A virus CY098518."
bs-serovar,Optional,"Taxonomy below subspecies; a variety (in bacteria, fungi or virus) usually based on its antigenic properties. Same as serovar and serotype. Sometimes used as species identifier in bacteria with shaky taxonomy, e.g. Leptospira, serovar saopaolo S76607 (65357 in Entrez)."
bs-specimen_voucher,Optional,"Identifier for the physical specimen. Use format: ""[<institution-code>:[<collection-code>:]]<specimen_id>"", eg, ""UAM:Mamm:52179"". Intended as a reference to the physical specimen that remains after it was analyzed. If the specimen was destroyed in the process of analysis, electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a physical voucher specimen. Ideally the specimens will be deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue collection, but often they will remain in a personal or laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in a curated collection. There are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers. If the text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a 'structured voucher'. Structured vouchers include institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides, please visit: http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-specimenvoucher-qualifier."
bs-subgroup,Optional,Taxonomy below subspecies; sometimes used in viruses to denote subgroups taken from a single isolate.
bs-subtype,Optional,"Used as classifier in viruses (e.g. HIV type 1, Group M, Subtype A)."
bs-title,Optional,"Optional internal field for how the BioSample submission should be named when viewed from the NCBI submission portal. If not provided, when performing submissions <--submission_name> with the suffix ""-BS"" will be used instead."
bs-comment,Optional,Optional internal field explaining the purpose of the submission for when interacting and resolving submission issues with NCBI.

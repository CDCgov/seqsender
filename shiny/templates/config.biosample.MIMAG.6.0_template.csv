bs-geo_loc_name,Required,"Geographical origin of the sample; use the appropriate name from this list http://www.insdc.org/documents/country-qualifier-vocabulary. Use a colon to separate the country or ocean from more detailed information about the location, eg ""Canada: Vancouver"" or ""Germany: halfway down Zugspitze, Alps"""
bs-isolation_source,Required,"Describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sample was derived."
bs-lat_lon,Required,"The geographical coordinates of the location where the sample was collected. Specify as degrees latitude and longitude in format ""d[d.dddd] N|S d[dd.dddd] W|E"", eg, 38.98 N 77.11 W"
bs-collection_method,Optional,"Process used to collect the sample, e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)"
bs-derived_from,Optional,Indicates when one BioSample was derived from another BioSample. Value should include BioSample accession number(s) (SAMNxxxxxxxx).

bs-omics_observ_id,Optional,"A unique identifier of the omics-enabled observatory (or comparable time series) your data derives from. This identifier should be provided by the OMICON ontology; if you require a new identifier for your time series, contact the ontology's developers. Information is available here: https://github.com/GLOMICON/omicon. This field is only applicable to records which derive from an omics time-series or observatory."
bs-pos_cont_type,Optional,"The substance, mixture, product, or apparatus used to verify that a process which is part of an investigation delivers a true positive"
bs-ref_biomaterial,Optional,Primary publication or genome report
bs-rel_to_oxygen,Optional,"Is this organism an aerobe, anaerobe? Please note that aerobic and anaerobic are valid descriptors for microbial environments, eg, aerobe, anaerobe, facultative, microaerophilic, microanaerobe, obligate aerobe, obligate anaerobe, missing, not applicable, not collected, not provided, restricted access"
bs-samp_collect_device,Optional,Method or device employed for collecting sample
bs-samp_mat_process,Optional,Processing applied to the sample during or after isolation
bs-samp_size,Optional,"Amount or size of sample (volume, mass or area) that was collected"
bs-samp_vol_we_dna_ext,Optional,volume (mL) or weight (g) of sample processed for DNA extraction
bs-size_frac,Optional,"Filtering pore size used in sample preparation, e.g., 0-0.22 micrometer"
bs-source_material_id,Optional,"unique identifier assigned to a material sample used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. The identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples."
bs-title,Optional,"Optional internal field for how the BioSample submission should be named when viewed from the NCBI submission portal. If not provided, when performing submissions <--submission_name> with the suffix ""-BS"" will be used instead."
bs-comment,Optional,Optional internal field explaining the purpose of the submission for when interacting and resolving submission issues with NCBI.

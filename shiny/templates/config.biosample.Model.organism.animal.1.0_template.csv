bs-specimen_voucher,Optional,"Identifier for the physical specimen. Use format: ""[<institution-code>:[<collection-code>:]]<specimen_id>"", eg, ""UAM:Mamm:52179"". Intended as a reference to the physical specimen that remains after it was analyzed. If the specimen was destroyed in the process of analysis, electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a physical voucher specimen. Ideally the specimens will be deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue collection, but often they will remain in a personal or laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in a curated collection. There are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers. If the text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a 'structured voucher'. Structured vouchers include institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides, please visit: http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-specimenvoucher-qualifier."

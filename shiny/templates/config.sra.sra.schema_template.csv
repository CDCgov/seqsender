column_name,required_column,description
sra-sample_name,Required,Identifier name used for SRA. Max length is 50 characters. Name must be unique from BioSample or Genbank submission.
bs-sample_name,Required,Identifier name used for BioSample. Max length is 50 characters. Required if submitting to SRA.
sra-file_location,Required,"Location of raw reads files. Options: ""local"" or ""cloud""."
sra-file_[1-9]\d*,Required,"Name of the raw read files. All file names must be unique and not contain any sensitive information. Files can be compressed using gzip or bzip2, and may be submitted in a tar archive but archiving and/or compressing your files is not required. Do not use zip! If there are multiple files, concatenate them with a commas ("",""), e.g. ""sample1_R1.fastq.gz, sample1_R2.fastq.gz"". Store files in /seqsender/data/raw_reads/ or provide full html path to the raw read files."
sra-library_name,Optional,Short unique identifier for sequencing library.
sra-loader,Optional,"SRA loader selection. If NCBI says your SRA files need to be uploaded with a certain loader, you can select it here."
sra-library_strategy,Required,The sequencing technique intended for the library.
sra-library_source,Required,The type of source material that is being sequenced.
sra-library_selection,Required,The method used to select and/or enrich the material being sequenced.

sra-platform,Optional,Instrument platform.
sra-instrument_model,Required,Instrument model used for sequencing.
sra-design_description,Optional,Brief description of materials/methods used for creating sequencing library.
sra-title,Optional,"Optional internal field for how the SRA submission should be named when viewed from the NCBI submission portal. If not provided, when performing submissions <--submission_name> with the suffix ""-SRA"" will be used instead."
sra-comment,Optional,Optional internal field explaining the purpose of the submission for when interacting and resolving submission issues with NCBI.

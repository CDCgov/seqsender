column_name,required_column,description
sra-sample_name,Required,Identifier name used for SRA. Max length is 50 characters. Name must be unique from BioSample/Genbank submission.
bs-sample_name,Required,Identifier name used for BioSample. Max length is 50 characters. Required if submitting to SRA.
sra-file_location,Required,"Location of raw reads files. Options: ""local"" or ""cloud""."
sra-file_1,Required,"All file names must be unique and not contain any sensitive information. Files can be compressed using gzip or bzip2, and may be submitted in a tar archive but archiving and/or compressing your files is not required. Do not use zip! If files are stored in the cloud, provide the full cloud url. If files are stored locally, if files are stored in the folder ""<--submission_dir>/raw_reads/"", then just the file name is required; otherwise, provide the full file path for the raw read."
sra-file_#,Optional,"Repeatable column, replace the ""#"" with the file number for each file associated with the sample. (i.e. If you had 4 separate raw reads files associated with one sample, then you would have 4 columns named: ""sra-file_1"", ""sra-file_2"", ""sra-file_3"", and ""sra-file_4"".) All file names must be unique and not contain any sensitive information. Files can be compressed using gzip or bzip2, and may be submitted in a tar archive but archiving and/or compressing your files is not required. Do not use zip! If files are stored in the cloud, provide the full cloud url. If files are stored locally, if files are stored in the folder ""<--submission_dir>/raw_reads/"", then just the file name is required; otherwise, provide the full file path for the raw read."
sra-library_name,Optional,Short unique identifier for sequencing library.
sra-loader,Optional,"SRA loader selection. If NCBI says your SRA files need to be uploaded with a certain loader, you can select it here."
sra-library_strategy,Required,The sequencing technique intended for the library.
sra-library_source,Required,The type of source material that is being sequenced.
sra-library_selection,Required,The method used to select and/or enrich the material being sequenced.
sra-library_layout,Required,"Whether to expect SINGLE or PAIRED end reads. Options: ""single"" or ""paired""."
sra-platform,Optional,Instrument platform.
sra-instrument_model,Required,Instrument model used for sequencing.
sra-design_description,Optional,Brief description of materials/methods used for creating sequencing library.
sra-title,Optional,"Optional internal field for how the SRA submission should be named when viewed from the NCBI submission portal. If not provided, when performing submissions <--submission_name> with the suffix ""-SRA"" will be used instead."
sra-comment,Optional,Optional internal field explaining the purpose of the submission for when interacting and resolving submission issues with NCBI.

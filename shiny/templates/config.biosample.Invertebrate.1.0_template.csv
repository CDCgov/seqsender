bs-sample_title,Required,Descriptive title for sample.
bs-sample_description,Optional,Optional description for sample.
bs-isolate,"At least one field required. Group: At least one required: Group ""Organism","At least one required: Group ""Organism"". identification or description of the specific individual from which this sample was obtained"
bs-breed,"At least one field required. Group: At least one required: Group ""Organism","At least one required: Group ""Organism"". breed name - chiefly used in domesticated animals or plants"
bs-host,"At least one field required. Group: At least one required: Group ""Source","At least one required: Group ""Source"". The natural (as opposed to laboratory) host to the organism from which the sample was obtained. Use the full taxonomic name, eg, ""Homo sapiens""."
bs-isolation_source,"At least one field required. Group: At least one required: Group ""Source","At least one required: Group ""Source"". Describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sample was derived."
bs-geo_loc_name,Required,"Geographical origin of the sample; use the appropriate name from this list http://www.insdc.org/documents/country-qualifier-vocabulary. Use a colon to separate the country or ocean from more detailed information about the location, eg ""Canada: Vancouver"" or ""Germany: halfway down Zugspitze, Alps"""
bs-tissue,Required,Type of tissue the sample was taken from.
bs-age,Optional,"age at the time of sampling; relevant scale depends on species and study, e.g. could be seconds for amoebae or centuries for trees"
bs-altitude,Optional,The altitude of the sample is the vertical distance between Earth's surface above Sea Level and the sampled position in the air.
bs-biomaterial_provider,Optional,"name and address of the lab or PI, or a culture collection identifier"
bs-collected_by,Optional,Name of persons or institute who collected the sample
bs-depth,Optional,"Depth is defined as the vertical distance below surface, e.g. for sediment or soil samples depth is measured from sediment or soil surface, respectivly. Depth can be reported as an interval for subsurface samples."
bs-dev_stage,Optional,Developmental stage at the time of sampling.
bs-env_broad_scale,Optional,Add terms that identify the major environment type(s) where your sample was collected. Recommend subclasses of biome [ENVO:00000428]. Multiple terms can be separated by one or more pipes e.g.:  mangrove biome [ENVO:01000181]|estuarine biome [ENVO:01000020]
bs-host_tissue_sampled,Optional,"name of body site where the sample was obtained from, such as a specific organ or tissue, e.g., tongue, lung. For foundational model of anatomy ontology (fma) (v 4.11.0) or Uber-anatomy ontology (UBERON) (v releases/2014-06-15) terms, please see http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/FMA or http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/UBERON"
bs-identified_by,Optional,name of the taxonomist who identified the specimen
bs-lat_lon,Optional,"The geographical coordinates of the location where the sample was collected. Specify as degrees latitude and longitude in format ""d[d.dddd] N|S d[dd.dddd] W|E"", eg, 38.98 N 77.11 W"
bs-sex,Optional,physical sex of sampled organism
bs-specimen_voucher,Optional,"Identifier for the physical specimen. Use format: ""[<institution-code>:[<collection-code>:]]<specimen_id>"", eg, ""UAM:Mamm:52179"". Intended as a reference to the physical specimen that remains after it was analyzed. If the specimen was destroyed in the process of analysis, electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a physical voucher specimen. Ideally the specimens will be deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue collection, but often they will remain in a personal or laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in a curated collection. There are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers. If the text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a 'structured voucher'. Structured vouchers include institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides, please visit: http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-specimenvoucher-qualifier."
bs-temp,Optional,temperature of the sample at time of sampling
bs-title,Optional,"Optional internal field for how the BioSample submission should be named when viewed from the NCBI submission portal. If not provided, when performing submissions <--submission_name> with the suffix ""-BS"" will be used instead."
bs-comment,Optional,Optional internal field explaining the purpose of the submission for when interacting and resolving submission issues with NCBI.

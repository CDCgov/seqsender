src-Haplotype,Optional,Haplotype of the organism.
src-Host,Optional,"When the sequence submission is from an organism that exists in a symbiotic, parasitic, or other special relationship with some second organism, the 'host' modifier can be used to identify the name of the host species."
src-Identified_by,Optional,name of the person or persons who identified by taxonomic name the organism from which the sequence was obtained
src-Isolate,Optional,Identification or description of the specific individual from which this sequence was obtained.
src-Isolation-source,Optional,Describes the local geographical source of the organism from which the sequence was obtained.

src-Lat_Lon,Optional,"Latitude and longitude, in decimal degrees, of where the sample was collected."
src-Note,Optional,Any additional information that you wish to provide about the sequence.
src-Pathovar,Optional,"Variety of a species (usually a fungus, bacteria or virus) characterized by the biological target of the pathogen. Examples include Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tabaci."
src-Pop_variant,Optional,name of the population variant from which the sequence was obtained
src-Rev_primer_name,Optional,name of reverse PCR primer
src-Rev_primer_seq,Optional,nucleotide sequence of reverse PCR primer
src-Segment,Optional,name of viral or phage segment sequenced
src-Serogroup,Optional,"Variety of a species (usually a fungus, bacteria, or virus) characterized by its antigenic properties. Same as serogroup and serovar."
src-Serotype,Optional,See Serogroup
src-Serovar,Optional,See Serogroup
src-Sex,Optional,Sex of the organism from which the sequence was obtained.
src-Specimen_voucher,Optional,"An identifier of the individual or collection of the source organism and the place where it is currently stored, usually an institution. This should be provided using the following format 'institution-code:collection-code:specimen-id'. specimen-id is mandatory, collection-code is optional; institution-code is mandatory when collection-code is provided.

column_name,required_column,description
sequence_name,Required,Sequence identifier used in fasta file. This is used to create the fasta file for Genbank or GISAID by updating the sequence name in your fasta file to reflect the sample name for the specified database.
gs-sample_name,Required,"Identifier name used for GISAID. Max length is 50 characters. This field is the same as ""covv_sequence_name"" in GISAID's metadata template."
gs-covv_type,Required,"For hCoV-19, this will always be ""betacoronavirus""."
gs-covv_passage,Required,"""Original"" if the sample was sequenced directly from swabs, otherwise add the name of the cell line (e.g., ""Vero"") used to culture the specimen."
gs-covv_location,Required,"Format as ""Continent / Country / Region / Sub-region""."
gs-covv_add_location,Optional,"Additional location information (e.g. Cruise Ship, Convention, Live animal market)."
gs-covv_host,Required,"Host species name. For Wastewater use ""Environment""."
gs-covv_add_host_info,Optional,Additional information regarding patient (e.g. Patient infected while interacting with animal).
gs-covv_sampling_strategy,Optional,"Sampling strategy for sequence (e.g. Sentinel surveillance (ILI), Sentinel surveillance (ARI), Sentinel surveillance (SARI), Non-sentinel-surveillance (hospital), Non-sentinel-surveillance (GP network), Longitudinal sampling on same patient(s), S gene dropout)."
gs-covv_sex,Required,"Biological sex. Should be ""Female"", ""Male"", or ""Unknown""."
gs-covv_patient_age,Required,"Age in years of the person from whom the specimen was collected. May take format other than numeric years, for example, ""0.5"" (i.e., 6 months), ""5 days"", ""7 months"". If units are not given, they are assumed in years. If missing, use ""Unknown""."
gs-covv_patient_status,Required,"E.g., ""Hospitalized"", ""Released"", ""Live"", ""Deceased"", ""Unknown""."
gs-covv_specimen,Optional,"Specimen source. For wastewater it must be ""Wastewater surveillance""."
gs-covv_outbreak,Optional,"Outbreak information (Date, Location e.g. type of gathering, Family cluster, etc.)."
gs-covv_last_vaccinated,Optional,Provide details if applicable.
gs-covv_treatment,Optional,"Provide details if applicable (e.g. Drug name, dosage)."
gs-covv_seq_technology,Required,"Add the sequencer brand and model (e.g. Illumina MiSeq, Sanger, Nanopore MinION)."
gs-covv_assembly_method,Optional,"Genome assembly algorithm (e.g. CLC Genomics Workbench 12, Geneious 10.2.4, SPAdes/MEGAHIT v1.2.9, UGENE v. 33)."
gs-covv_coverage,Optional,"Average genome coverage (e.g. 50x, 100x, 1,000x)."
gs-covv_orig_lab,Required,Full name of laboratory from where sample originated.
gs-covv_orig_lab_addr,Required,Complete building address of laboratory from where sample originated.
gs-covv_provider_sample_id,Optional,ID used by originating lab.
gs-covv_subm_lab,Required,Full name of laboratory submitting this record to GISAID.
gs-covv_subm_lab_addr,Required,Complete building address of the submitting laboratory.
gs-covv_subm_sample_id,Optional,ID used by submitting lab.
gs-covv_consortium,Optional,Sequencing consortium the submitting lab is affiliated with.

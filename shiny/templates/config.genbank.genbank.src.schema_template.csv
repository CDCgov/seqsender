column_name,required_column,description
src-Altitude,Optional,Altitude in metres above or below sea level of where the sample was collected.
src-Bio_material,Optional,"An identifier for the biological material from which the nucleotide sequence was obtained, with optional institution code and collection code for the place where it is currently stored. This should be provided using the following format 'institution-code:collection-code:material_id'. material_id is mandatory, institution-code and collection-code are optional; institution-code is mandatory when collection-code is present. This qualifier should be used to annotate the identifiers of material in biological collections which include zoos and aquaria, stock centers, seed banks, germplasm repositories and DNA banks."
src-Breed,Optional,The named breed from which sequence was obtained (usually applied to domesticated mammals).
src-Cell_line,Optional,Cell line from which sequence was obtained.
src-Cell_type,Optional,Type of cell from which sequence was obtained.
src-Clone,Optional,Name of clone from which sequence was obtained.
src-Collected_by,Optional,Name of person who collected the sample.
src-geo_loc_name,Required,"Geographical origin of the sample; use the appropriate name from this list http://www.insdc.org/documents/country-qualifier-vocabulary. Use a colon to separate the country or ocean from more detailed information about the location, eg ""Canada: Vancouver"" or ""Germany: halfway down Zugspitze, Alps""."
src-Cultivar,Optional,Cultivated variety of plant from which sequence was obtained.
src-Culture_collection,Optional,"Institution code and identifier for the culture from which the nucleotide sequence was obtained, with optional collection code. This should be provided using the following format 'institution-code:collection-code:culture-id'. culture-id and institution-code are mandatory. This qualifier should be used to annotate live microbial and viral cultures, and cell lines that have been deposited in curated culture collections."
src-Dev_stage,Optional,Developmental stage of organism.
src-Ecotype,Optional,The named ecotype (population adapted to a local habitat) from which sequence was obtained (customarily applied to populations of Arabidopsis thaliana).
src-Fwd_primer_name,Optional,name of forward PCR primer
src-Fwd_primer_seq,Optional,nucleotide sequence of forward PCR primer
src-Genotype,Optional,Genotype of the organism.
src-Haplogroup,Optional,Name for a group of similar haplotypes that share some sequence variation
src-Haplotype,Optional,Haplotype of the organism.
src-Host,Required,"When the sequence submission is from an organism that exists in a symbiotic, parasitic, or other special relationship with some second organism, the 'host' modifier can be used to identify the name of the host species."
src-Isolate,Required,Identification or description of the specific individual from which this sequence was obtained.
src-Isolation-source,Optional,Describes the local geographical source of the organism from which the sequence was obtained.
src-Lab_host,Optional,Laboratory host used to propagate the organism from which the sequence was obtained.
src-Lat_Lon,Optional,"Latitude and longitude, in decimal degrees, of where the sample was collected."
src-Note,Optional,Any additional information that you wish to provide about the sequence.
src-Rev_primer_name,Optional,name of reverse PCR primer
src-Rev_primer_seq,Optional,nucleotide sequence of reverse PCR primer
src-Segment,Optional,name of viral or phage segment sequenced
src-Serotype,Optional,See Serogroup
src-Serovar,Optional,See Serogroup
src-Sex,Optional,Sex of the organism from which the sequence was obtained.
src-Specimen_voucher,Optional,"An identifier of the individual or collection of the source organism and the place where it is currently stored, usually an institution. This should be provided using the following format 'institution-code:collection-code:specimen-id'. specimen-id is mandatory, collection-code is optional; institution-code is mandatory when collection-code is provided. Examples: 99-SRNP UAM:Mamm:52179 personal collection:Joe Smith:99-SRNP AMCC:101706"
src-Strain,Optional,Strain of organism from which sequence was obtained.
src-Sub_species,Optional,Subspecies of organism from which sequence was obtained.
src-Tissue_lib,Optional,Tissue library from which the sequence was obtained.
src-Tissue_type,Optional,Type of tissue from which sequence was obtained.
src-Variety,Optional,Variety of organism from which sequence was obtained.

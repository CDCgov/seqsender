**Have you attempted to upload your organism using SeqSender? If so, please list the organism affected. If not, please attempt using SeqSender with it first, as SeqSender currently supports a wide variety of organisms, databases, and submission options.**
Be sure to check the Submission Wizard in the documentation for all the available customizations for submitting your samples to repositories.

**Which databases are you uploading to? Are all of them affected? If not list which ones are affected:**
BIOSAMPLE/SRA/GENBANK/GISAID

**Is the problem related to a metadata field, an additional file, available submission options, or the submission process itself?**
If the field is only an attribute, it can be added to any database even if not validated by SeqSender, by simply adding the correct column name with the database prefix.

**If possible describe the solution you'd like to see along with any other additional details.**
A clear and concise description of what you think needs to change/made available to resolve your issue.
